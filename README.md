# Cars-Classification-Based-on-CNN
# Overview
In this project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying cars into 42 categories using the Car Collection dataset. Employing advanced image preprocessing techniques, including normalization and rotation, enhanced the effectiveness of model training. I utilized the VGG-16 architecture, incorporating three convolutional layers, two pooling layers, two linear layers, and a dropout layer. Hyperparameter optimization, including iterations, learning rate, and L2 regularization, was performed on GPU to prevent overfitting. The project involved testing and comparing the performance of the VGG-16 model against a self-built CNN model, with the latter achieving the best accuracy at 60%.
